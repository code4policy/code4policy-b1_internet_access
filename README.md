#Project description: This project presents an overview of gender gaps in mobile internet access across the globe with specific focus on 8 countries with the largest gaps. We highlight the issue, top barriers to mobile internet access for women, and some recommendations for international donor organizations to help guide their funding decisions.  

#Data tranformation:
Visualizations have been created using D3 and Flourish. The website contains four graphs - three of them have been created using D3 and one on Flourish. Data for all the graphs have been drawn from the GSMA Connected Women - The Mobile Gender Gap Report 2021. Report link - https://www.gsma.com/r/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/The-Mobile-Gender-Gap-Report-2021.pdf

The team brainstormed on user stories and identified graphs from the report that best conveyed the intended message. The raw data that was used to create the above report was difficult to access and cumbersome to clean and shape in a format that would be useful for the project. The team was interested in implementing the coding skills gained from this course and did not want to spend copious amounts of time restructuring raw data. Hence, data points were taken directly from the graphs in the report and coded into .csv files. 

The .csv files were then used to create the D3 and Flourish visualizations and can be found in the "data" folder in the repository. For both bar graphs, the code for creating a .csv file of the data can be found in the python files. For the heatmap and Flourish chart, data was manually entered into .csv files and imported into the javascript code/Flourish dashboard. 

#Folder structures:
All files related to the project have been organized in the following folders -
1. index.html - contains HTML code for the landing page
2. barriers.html, recommendations.html, about-us.html - contains HTML code for other three webpages
3. scripts - contains all the javascript codes
4. styles - contains all CSS styling codes for the website
5. data - contains all .csv files used for data analysis on D3 and Flourish
