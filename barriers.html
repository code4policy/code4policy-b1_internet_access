        <p id = 'graph-commentary'> Cost of mobile phones, literacy (reading/writing difficulties), and lack of understanding about how to use mobile internet stand out as the three primary barriers to mobile internet access and usage among women in most of the developing countries listed above. This also indicates that while women might be increasingly owning and using mobile phones, phones that can enable internet access i.e. smartphones, still remain unavailable to a large section of women across the globe. Literacy levels of women also seem to be impacting their ability to use internet on their mobile phones, despite being aware that such facilities exist. </p>
