<p align = "center"> Cost of mobile phones, literacy (reading/writing difficulties), and lack of understanding about how to use mobile internet stand out as the three primary barriers <br> to mobile internet access and usage among women in most of the developing countries listed above. This also indicates that while women might be increasingly <br> owning and using mobile phones, phones that can enable internet access i.e. smartphones, still remain inaccesible for a large section of women across the globe. <br> Literacy levels of women also seem to be impacting their ability to use internet on their mobile phones, despite being aware that such mobile internet facilities exist. </p>
